            "Description": "One of the finest classic works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, it is one of the parts of the complete works Sherlock Homes",
            "Summary": "All of the stories within The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes are told in a first-person narrative from the point of view of Dr. Watson, as is the case for all but four of the Sherlock Holmes stories. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography entry for Doyle suggests that the short stories contained in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes tend to point out social injustices, such as a king's betrayal of an opera singer, a stepfather's deception of his ward as a fictitious lover, an aristocratic crook's exploitation of a failing pawnbroker, a beggar's extensive estate in Kent.It suggests that, in contrast, Holmes is portrayed as offering a fresh and fair approach in an unjust world of official incompetence and aristocratic privilege. The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes contains many of Doyle's favourite Sherlock Holmes stories. In 1927, he submitted a list of what he believed were his twelve best Sherlock Holmes stories to The Strand Magazine. Among those he listed were The Adventure of the Speckled Band (as his favourite), The Red-Headed League (second), A Scandal in Bohemia (fifth) and The Five Orange Pips (seventh)."
